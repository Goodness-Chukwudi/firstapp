            <h1>Early browsers</h1>
            <p>Initially, a web browser was available only for the NeXT operating system. This 
                shortcoming was discussed in January 1992,[14] and alleviated in April 1992 by the 
                release of Erwise, an application developed at the Helsinki University of Technology
                and in May by ViolaWWW, created by Pei-Yuan Wei, which included advanced features such
                 as embedded graphics, scripting, and animation.[12] ViolaWWW was originally an appli
                 cation for HyperCard. Both programs ran on the X Window System for Unix.[12] In 1992,
                  the first tests between browsers on different platforms were concluded successfully
                   between buildings 513 and 31 in CERN, between browsers on the NexT station and the
                    X11-ported Mosaic browser.

                Students at the University of Kansas adapted an existing text-only hypertext browser, Lynx, to access the web. Lynx was available on Unix and DOS, and some web designers, unimpressed with glossy graphical websites, held that a website not accessible through Lynx wasn't worth visiting.</p>

                <h1>Web governance</h1>
                <P>In May 1994, the first International WWW Conference, organized by Robert
                     Cailliau,[10][39] was held at CERN;[40] the conference has been held every year
                      since. In April 1993, CERN had agreed that anyone could use the Web protocol
                       and code royalty-free; this was in part a reaction to the concern caused by
                        the University of Minnesota's announcement that it would begin charging 
                        license fees for its implementation of the Gopher protocol.

                    In September 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium
                     (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with support from the
                      Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the European Commission.
                       It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and 
                       recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made the Web 
                       available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The W3C decided that 
                       its standards must be based on royalty-free technology, so they can be easily
                        adopted by anyone.</P>
